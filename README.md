## Introduction

I developed the web platform "Nuestra voz es la voz de la historia", a historical documentation project about the conflict over the Islas Malvinas, Georgias del Sur y Sandwich del Sur.

Initially, the website was designed and developed using WordPress, leveraging its intuitive content management environment. However, due to hosting limitations on GitHub Pages, a decision was made to manually migrate the entire development to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The migration was carried out with the utmost fidelity to the original design and concept, incorporating visual and performance enhancements to optimize the user experience without compromising the essence of the site.

## Explanation of each branch

### main

This branch contains the initial README file with a detailed explanation of the project, including its purpose, development process, and structure.

### wordpress

This branch stores the original website code developed in WordPress, including all associated assets, themes, and plugins used during the initial phase of the project.

### html-css-js

This branch contains the manually migrated version of the website, rewritten in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It preserves the original design while optimizing performance and compatibility with GitHub Pages.

## Privacy Policy and Legal Requirements

This website does not collect, store, or process any personal data from its visitors. It does not use cookies, registration forms, or tracking tools.

The sole purpose of this site is historical and documentary, with no commercial or profit-driven intentions. This section has been included to comply with Argentina's current legal regulations regarding privacy and data protection.

If any future functionality requires data collection, this policy will be updated to ensure transparency and respect for user privacy.

## SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

The website has been developed following the fundamental principles of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) to ensure optimal visibility and performance in search engines. Special attention has been given to content quality and relevance, proper use of keywords, image optimization, and the creation of user-friendly URLs.

Additionally, an intuitive navigation system and fast load times have been implemented to provide a superior user experience across all devices.

The website also features technical optimization that facilitates search engine indexing, as well as the integration of quality links and an effective backlink strategy. This comprehensive approach helps improve the website's position in organic search results, attracting relevant and consistent traffic.

## Responsive Design

While not all possible optimizations have been implemented to achieve a fully responsive design, several measures have been taken to ensure proper display on most devices. These include using relative units, setting minimum and maximum values ​​for elements, and adjusting margins and borders based on screen size, allowing the site to adapt with minimal changes to most devices.

In future versions, i will seek to optimize this section to improve the user experience.
